## Weather Provider Help
### OpenWeatherMap
Head over [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)  and create an account. Get the API key. Open the applet configuration and plop it in. If you don't live in a major city, it might not pick up your location. I'd suggest reading [here](https://openweathermap.org/current#one) to ascertain your location.



## Requirements

* [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon) 1.8+ 

For compatibility with Cinnamon 1.7 or earlier, use an [archived](https://github.com/mockturtl/cinnamon-weather/tags) version.

## Configuration

Right-click to access `cinnamon-settings` -> _Applets -> Configure_.
